# PyBer Analysis

## Objective
The purpose of this analysis is to get more detail on how ridership varies among the three city types.

## Results
### Totals by City Type
[Totals by City Type Summary](Analysis/Totals_by_Type.png)
<p>The leader in total rides, drivers, and fares is the urban city category, with suburban coming in second, and rural in third. This makes logical sense for total rides and drivers based on population density. There are more people in urban areas not only looking for rides, but also available for the driver pool. Urban cities leading the total fare category is a matter of scale more so than density, as the number of rides in urban areas far outpaces either suburban or rural areas.
<p>While the total fares for each city type vary from week to week, they tend to stay in a $500 - $700 band, suggesting that overall demand is relatively consistent. 
### Averages by City Type
[Averages by City Type Summary](Analysis/Averages_by_Type.png)
<p>When you look at the average fare per ride, you find that the rural cities have the greatest value, followed by suburban and then urban. Again, this is a somewhat expected result, as the more rural an area gets, the more spread out things tend to be, which leads to a longer average ride.

The interesting statistic, however is Average Fare per Driver. Whereas total rides and average fare per ride are predominately determined by the rider pool, the company can manipulate the average fare per driver by adjusting driver allocation across the city types. The current data shows a glut of drivers in the urban areas with the average fare per driver being over 30% less than the average fare per ride. By contrast, both suburban and rural average fares per driver are greater than the average fare per ride, at 27 % and 60% respectively. 


## Recommendations
### Target Rural Areas
Rural cities provide the best average fare of the three city types, but may also be underserved by drivers. Develop an ad campaign to increase ridership in rural areas. Concurrently, build the rural driver pools, either by recruiting new drivers, or incentivizing current urban drivers to switch to a rural area.
 
### Institute a Cap on Drivers
The urban areas seem to have more drivers than necessary. Take a closer look at drivers per city and determine the ideal number of drivers based on demand. Set the cap close to the ideal number and once that number has been reached, offer new drivers a different coverage area, or the motion of going on a wait list.

# PyBer Analysis

## Objective
The purpose of this analysis is to get more detail on how ridership varies among the three city types.

## Results
### Totals by City Type
The leader in total rides, drivers, and fares is the urban city category, with suburban coming in second, and rural in third. This makes logical sense for total rides and drivers based on population density. There are more people in urban areas not only looking for rides, but also available for the driver pool. Urban cities leading the total fare category is a matter of scale more so than density, as the number of rides in urban areas far outpaces either suburban or rural areas.

### Averages by City Type
When you look at the average fare per ride, you find that the rural cities have the greatest value.
